Bavarian card-game Watten with AI
=================================

This project is an implementation of the bavarian card-game "Watten".
In the human vs. CPU-games it is the players task to get 3 points faster than the machine does.
To accomplish this, the project contains an AI with adjustable difficulty using an minimax-algorithm.

For the rules cf. http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watten (german)
